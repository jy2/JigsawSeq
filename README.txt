JigsawSeq
=========
Comprehensive sequence profiling of gene variant libraries is important as it is broadly applicable for fine mapping studies in genotype-phenotype relations. JigsawSeq is a protocol to generate and evaluate a full-length gene variant library by combining codon-based molecular barcoding strategy and de novo assembly.
This program 'JigsawSeq' is a package for ananlyzing next-generation data from JigsawSeq experiments. 

Version: r3
Last modified Apr-13-2015

Requirement
===========
- Data: NGS data for codon-barcoded variant library. Hiseq (Illumina) is highly recommended.
- Memory: apr. 20Gb for analazing 1Gb size of fastq files.
- CPU: 3 cores or more
- Software versions: perl 5.10 or higher, bwa 0.7.9a-r786, samtools 0.1.19-44428cd or higher
  cf. bwa and samtools are included in this package.
- Others: vector sequence using for variant library is required. (fasta format)

Tips
====
If vector is generated by Gibbs cloning, writing sequences around break points on 'exclusion.fa' is recommended.
Too many sequencing errors will significantly increase the running time and memory usage
Trimming tails of reads based on quality scores and meaningless poly-A will improve running time and memory usage.

Highly recommend trim first. 
reads with only A,T,C,G
